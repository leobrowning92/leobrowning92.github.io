                    <h3>Work</h3>
                    <p>I work as a PhD candidate with The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Victoria University of wellington. The topic of my research is Ag nanowire based Neural networks and CNT FET's for device and sensor applications. My work consists of microfabrication techniques and nanowire synthesis to produce electrical devices in Victoria University's Cleanroom fabrication facillity. After creation SEM, AFM and IV spectroscopy are used to characterize them.</p>

                    <p>I have a couple of active projects (this site is one of them!) some of them include: </p>
                    <li>An open source spectrometer for science outreach</li>
                    <li>Introductory spectrometer using only a webcam and a computer for primary school demonstrations </li>
                    <p> I am always interested in helping with projects that help with science education or outreach.</p>

                    <p>
                        Im an avid supporter of the open manufacturing movement. I have built and used a Prusa i3 3d printer and am fascinated by lasercutting and 3d printing. Im currently on the lookout for a more traditional workshop space to exercise my crative itch. I've playd
                        D&D on and off since I was 12, and love to talk with others about the greatest fantasy game ever made.

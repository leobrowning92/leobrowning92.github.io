                    <h3>Work</h3>
                    <p>I am a 23 year old PhD candidate with The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Victoria University of Wellington on silver nanowire based neural networks and CNT FET's for device and sensor applications.</p>
                    <p>My work consists of microfabrication techniques and nanowire synthesis to produce electrical devices in Victoria University's Cleanroom fabrication facillity. After creation SEM, AFM and IV spectroscopy are used to characterize devices.</p>

                        <li> An introductory spectrometer using only a webcam and a computer for primary school demonstrations </li>
                    </P>
                    <p> I am always interested in new projects involving science education or outreach.</p>

                    <h3>Other Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am an avid supporter of the open manufacturing movement. I've built and used a Prusa i3 3d printer and am fascinated by lasercutting and 3d printing. I'm currently on the lookout for workshop space to explore this further and get making things. I've played
                        D&D on and off since I was 12, and love to talk with others about the greatest fantasy game ever made. To keep active I play Ultimate Frisbee and table tennis as much as I can.
